Multiply the number of cupcakes sold in the morning (90) by the price per cupcake ($2.50):\n\n90 x $2.50 = $225\n\nSo, the bakery makes $225 from selling cupcakes in the morning.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the remaining cupcakes:\n\nAfter selling 90 cupcakes in the morning, there are:\n120 - 90 = 30 cupcakes left.\n\nThese 30 cupcakes will be sold at half price in the afternoon.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the revenue from selling cupcakes in the afternoon:\n\nThe bakery sells each of these 30 cupcakes for $2.50 / 2 = $1.25 (half price).\n\nMultiply the number of cupcakes sold in the afternoon (30) by the price per cupcake ($1.25):\n\n30 x $1.25 = $37.50\n\nSo, the bakery makes $37.50 from selling cupcakes in the afternoon.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total revenue:\n\nAdd the revenue from selling cupcakes in the morning and the afternoon:\n$225 + $37.50 = $262.50\n\nThe bakery makes a total of $262.50.",
