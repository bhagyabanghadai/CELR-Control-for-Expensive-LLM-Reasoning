      "output": "To find the total revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from the morning sales and the afternoon sales separately.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of cupcakes sold in the morning**\n\nThe bakery sells 3/4 of the 120 cupcakes in the morning. To calculate this:\n\n3/4 \u00d7 120 = (3 \u00d7 120) / 4\n= 360 / 4\n= 90\n\nSo, the bakery sells 90 cupcakes in the morning.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from morning sales**\n\nThe price of each cupcake is $2.50. Since 90 cupcakes were sold at this price:\n\nRevenue (morning) = Number of cupcakes \u00d7 Price per cupcake\n= 90 \u00d7 $2.50\n= $225\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of cupcakes left for afternoon sales**\n\nSince 90 cupcakes were sold in the morning, the remaining number of cupcakes is:\n\n120 - 90 = 30\n\nSo, 30 cupcakes are left to be sold at half price.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the revenue from afternoon sales**\n\nThe price of each cupcake is halved in the afternoon. Therefore, the new price per cupcake is $2.50 / 2 = $1.25.\n\nRevenue (afternoon) = Number of cupcakes \u00d7 Price per cupcake\n= 30 \u00d7 $1.25\n= $37.50\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total revenue**\n\nThe bakery earns revenue from both morning and afternoon sales:\n\nTotal Revenue = Revenue (morning) + Revenue (afternoon)\n= $225 + $37.50\n= $262.50\n\nTherefore, the bakery makes a total of $262.50 in revenue.",

Now that we know Jerry has 13 marbles and Tom has 3 times as many marbles as Jerry, we can multiply the number of marbles Jerry has by 3 to find out how many marbles Tom has:\n\nTom's marbles = Jerry's marbles x 3\nTom's marbles = 13 x 3\nTom's marbles = 39\n\n4. Now that we know each person has a certain number of marbles, we can add them up to find the total number of marbles they have altogether:\n\nTotal marbles = Sam's marbles + Jerry's marbles + Tom's marbles\nTotal marbles = 8 + 13 + 39\nTotal marbles = 60\n\nTherefore, Tom, Jerry, and Sam have a total of 60 marbles.",
